# Seminar_ENS_Spices_and_Additives

This project investigates the energy demand and specific energy consumption (SEC) of spice and additive processing, focusing on two representative products: red pepper and mustard oil. The study uses a process-based modeling approach to quantify energy inputs for each unit operation such as drying, grinding, and oil extraction—within well-defined system boundaries.

The uploaded DOCX file includes detailed calculations, mass and energy balances, and assumptions behind the pepper paste, pepper powder, and mustard oil processing pathways. These calculations support the findings presented in the full seminar report and aim to promote transparency, reproducibility, and integration of food-processing data into sustainable energy system modeling.
